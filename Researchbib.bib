abstract  ="Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as additives (fillers) exhibit enhanced gas permeabilities and possibly also selectivities when compared to the pure polymer. Polyimides (Matrimid[registered sign]) and polysulfones are popular polymer matrices for MOF fillers. Presently investigated MOFs for MMMs include [Cu(SiF6)(4{,}4[prime or minute]-BIPY)2]{,} [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3] (HKUST-1{,} Cu-BTC){,} [Cu(BDC)(DMF)]{,} [Zn4O(BDC)3] (MOF-5){,} [Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2] (ZIF-8){,} [Zn(purinate)2] (ZIF-20){,} [Zn(2-carboxyaldehyde imidazolate)2] (ZIF-90){,} Mn(HCOO)2{,} [Al(BDC)([small mu ]-OH)] (MIL-53(Al)){,} [Al(NH2-BDC)([small mu ]-OH)] (NH2-MIL-53(Al)) and [Cr3O(BDC)3(F{,}OH)(H2O)2] (MIL-101) (4{,}4[prime or minute]-BIPY = 4{,}4[prime or minute]-bipyridine{,} BTC = benzene-1{,}3{,}5-tricarboxylate{,} BDC = benzene-1{,}4-dicarboxylate{,} terephthalate). MOF particle adhesion to polyimide and polysulfone organic polymers does not represent a problem. MOF-polymer MMMs are investigated for the permeability of the single gases H2{,} N2{,} O2{,} CH4{,} CO2 and of the gas mixtures O2/N2{,} H2/CH4{,} CO2/CH4{,} H2/CO2{,} CH4/N2 and CO2/N2 (preferentially permeating gas named first). Permeability increases can be traced to the MOF porosity. Since the porosity of MOFs can be tuned very precisely{,} which is not possible with polymeric material{,} MMMs offer the opportunity of significantly increasing the selectivity compared to the pure polymeric matrix. Additionally in most of the cases the permeability is increased for MMM membranes compared to the pure polymer. Addition of MOFs to polymers in MMMs easily yields performances similar to the best polymer membranes and gives higher selectivities than those reported to date for any pure MOF membrane for the same gas separation. MOF-polymer MMMs allow for easier synthesis and handability compared to pure MOF membranes."}

abstract = { Zeolites are one of humanity’s most important synthetic products. These aluminosilicate-based materials represent a large segment of the global economy. Indeed, the value of zeolites used in petroleum refining as catalysts and in detergents as water softeners is estimated at $350 billion per year. A major current goal in zeolite chemistry is to create a structure in which metal ions and functionalizable organic units make up an integral part of the framework. Such a structure, by virtue of the flexibility with which metal ions and organic moieties can be varied, is viewed as a key to further improving zeolite properties and accessing new applications. Recently, it was recognized that the Si−O−Si preferred angle in zeolites (145°) is coincident with that of the bridging angle in the M−Im−M fragment (where M is Zn or Co and Im is imidazolate), and therefore it should be possible to make new zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with topologies based on those of tetrahedral zeolites. This idea was successful and proved to be quite fruitful; within the last 5 years over 90 new ZIF structures have been reported. The recent application of high-throughput synthesis and characterization of ZIFs has expanded this structure space significantly: it is now possible to make ZIFs with topologies previously unknown in zeolites, in addition to mimicking known structures. In this Account, we describe the general preparation of crystalline ZIFs, discussing the methods that have been developed to create and analyze the variety of materials afforded. We include a comprehensive list of all known ZIFs, including structure, topology, and pore metrics. We also examine how complexity might be introduced into new structures, highlighting how link−link interactions might be exploited to effect particular cage sizes, create polarity variations between pores, or adjust framework robustness, for example. The chemical and thermal stability of ZIFs permit many applications, such as the capture of CO2 and its selective separation from industrially relevant gas mixtures. Currently, ZIFs are the best porous materials for the selective capture of CO2; furthermore, they show exceptionally high capacity for CO2 among adsorbents operating by physisorption. The stability of ZIFs has also enabled organic transformations to be carried out on the crystals, yielding covalently functionalized isoreticular structures wherein the topology, crystallinity, and porosity of the ZIF structure are maintained throughout the reaction process. These reactions, being carried out on macroscopic crystals that behave as single molecules, have enabled the realization of the chemist’s dream of using “crystals as molecules”, opening the way for the application of the extensive library of organic reactions to the functionalization of useful extended porous structures. }

However{,} ZIF-8 shows flexibility due to the swing of the imidazolate linkers{,} which results in the adsorption of molecules which are too large to fit through the narrow window. In this work{,} we assess the impact of this flexibility{,} previously only observed for nitrogen{,} and the level of agreement between the experimental and simulated isotherms of different energy-related gases on ZIF-8 (CO2{,} CH4 and alkanes). We combine experimental gas adsorption with GCMC simulations{,} using generic and adjusted force fields and DFT calculations with the Grimme dispersion correction. By solely adapting the UFF force field to reduce the Lennard-Jones parameter ?{,} we achieve excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental results not only for ZIF-8 but also for ZIF-20{,} where the transferability of the adapted force field is successfully tested. Regarding ZIF-8{,} we show that two different structural configurations are needed to properly describe the adsorption performance of this material{,} demonstrating that ZIF-8 is undergoing a structural change during gas adsorption. DFT calculations with the Grimme dispersion correction are consistent with the GCMC and experimental observations{,} illustrating the thermodynamics of the CH4 adsorption sites and confirming the existence of a new adsorption site with a high binding energy within the 4-ring window of ZIF-8."}

abstract ={A high-throughput protocol was developed for the synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Twenty-five different ZIF crystals were synthesized from only 9600 microreactions of either zinc(II)/cobalt(II) and imidazolate/imidazolate-type linkers. All of the ZIF structures have tetrahedral frameworks: 10 of which have two different links (heterolinks), 16 of which are previously unobserved compositions and structures, and 5 of which have topologies as yet unobserved in zeolites. Members of a selection of these ZIFs (termed ZIF-68, ZIF-69, and ZIF-70) have high thermal stability (up to 390°C) and chemical stability in refluxing organic and aqueous media. Their frameworks have high porosity (with surface areas up to 1970 square meters per gram), and they exhibit unusual selectivity for CO2 capture from CO2/CO mixtures and extraordinary capacity for storing CO2: 1 liter of ZIF-69 can hold ∼83 liters of CO2 at 273 kelvin under ambient pressure.},

abstract  ="Gas separation technologies for carbon-free hydrogen and clean gaseous fuel production must efficiently perform the following separations: (1) H2/CO2 (and H2/N2) for pre-combustion coal gasification{,} (2) CO2/N2 for post-combustion of coal{,} (3) CO2/CH4 for natural gas sweetening and biofuel purification{,} and (4) O2/N2 for oxy-combustion of coal. By utilizing a molecular simulation approach{,} Monte Carlo procedures{,} free volume analysis{,} and continuum modeling{,} we predict the intrinsic gas permeability and separation properties of several new Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs){,} a family of the Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). The well defined pore sizes in conjunction with high surface areas make ZIFs prime candidates for molecular sieving. In this work{,} our calculated intrinsic properties are compared with current experimental results where ZIFs are either grown in dense layers to form pure inorganic membranes on porous supports or dispersed within a polymer phase to form mixed matrix membranes. Consequently{,} this paper assesses current membrane development according to industrial feasibility targets and highlights the achievable superior separation results for ideal membrane configurations. For example{,} ZIF-11 is discovered to be capable of sieving H2 from all of its larger gas counterparts at a remarkable H2/CO2 selectivity of 262 and H2 permeability of 5830 Barrer{,} well within the target area for efficient hydrogen production."}

Abstract = {{A seeded growth procedure was used to successfully prepare continuous
   and well inter-grown zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) membranes
   on porous a-alumina tubes. The effects of some parameters including the
   content of seeds and PEI in seeding solution, the concentration of
   sodium formate in synthesis solution and synthesis temperature on the
   formation of ZIF-8 membranes were investigated in detail. The
   characterization of SEM, XRD and single gas permeation showed that PEI
   added in the seeding solution can improve the adhesion between the seed
   crystals and the support surface. Moreover, sodium formate used in
   synthesis solution could prevent the seed layer from peeling off during
   the membrane growing process. The as-synthesized ZIF-8 membrane is well
   inter-grown and continuous. Single gas permeation shows that the
   separation factors of H-2/CO2 and H-2/CH4 are 5.4 and 2.56,
   respectively, indicating that Knudsen diffusion plays a controlling role
   in the gas permeation through the ZIF-8 membrane.}},

ZIF-8 crystals were prepared by mixing 2-methylimidazole (Hmim) with Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn) in deionized water. The products prepared at high Hmim/Zn molar ratios were assigned to a sodalite (SOD)-type structure whose morphology consisted of a rhombic dodecahedron with truncated corners. The crystals possessed ultrahigh surface areas and micropore volumes. At low Hmim/Zn molar ratio{,} some zinc hydroxide and basic zinc nitrate were observed in the products. We also focused on the formation process of ZIF-8 crystals in an aqueous system by observing the change in the pH value as a function of synthesis time. We tried to calculate the stability constant of ZIF-8 by fitting the calculated pH values to the measured pH values. When the molar fractions of the zinc compounds in the equilibrium state were calculated{,} high fractions of the Zn(mim)2 complex were observed at high concentrations of Hmim. On the other hand{,} some zinc cations were present at low concentrations of Hmim. This finding would support a causal relationship between these zinc cations and the formation of some by-products."}

abstract  ="Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly ordered crystalline materials prepared by the self-assembly of metal ions with organic linkers to yield low density network structures of diverse topology. MOFs have attracted considerable attention over the last decade due to their facile preparation{,} tunable pore metrics and the ease of functionalisation of their internal surfaces{,} such that designer frameworks with exceptional properties for application in gas-storage{,} separation of small molecules{,} heterogeneous catalysis and drug delivery are becoming commonplace. For any material to find practical utility however{,} there is a need for processing and formulation into application-specific configurations. One way to do this is to prepare composite materials where the MOF is supported on a planar substrate or some other shaped body through interaction with functional groups at the support interface. This is a rapidly developing research area{,} and this review provides an overview of the diverse MOF composite materials prepared up to now{,} organised by interface type. The importance of the interface is explored within each section and while the overall emphasis is on applications of the composites{,} coatings and MOF-based devices{,} the most widely-used and successful synthetic strategies for composite formation are also presented.

The facile nature of the composite preparation is in part due to the inherent hydrophilicity and processability of the PAM{,} which bears suitable functionality to interact with the MOF. The resulting composites display hierarchical porosity across the macro- and microporous length scales; the MOF loading level{,} and hence degree of microporosity in the composites{,} can be tuned by modulating the concentration of the reactants in the MOF synthesis. The MOF@PAM beads display enhanced mechanical stability and handling over bulk MOF phases in heterogeneous reaction systems{,} clearly indicating that such materials can improve recovery and recyclability of crystalline MOFs. This is an important step for future applications."}
