\begin{quotation}
Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel,
that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will
furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which
coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the tenders of
locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these two condensed
gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific power. There
is, therefore, nothing to fear. 
\raggedleft Jules Verne, \emph{The Mysterious Island}\cite{vernemysterious}

The Jules Verne quotation from \emph{The Mysterious Island}  probably  represents the earliest mention of using hydrogen as fuel. This idea is still very much viable and attracts plenty of interest from both academia and industry alike*.

A similar problem of the modern age is the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and with CO$_2$ emissions reaching average levels above 400 ppm for the first time in measurable history.
